This module was developed by Benedek Kiss at the [Department of Construction Materials and Technologies](https://em.bme.hu/?language=en)
of the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en)
within the research project: “Optimisation of buildings and building elements from life cycle and building physics perspective
based on complex numeric modelling” (Project FK 128663) The project been implemented with the support provided from the National Research,
Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary, financed under the FK_18 funding scheme.

This software uses open-source packages.
